**Android Application Project Structure: Android_CocktailSelector**

# Part A
This acts as the 3rd Party API for the Android_CocktailSelector project. This fetches data from a 3rd party API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). It then parses the json and gets only the required data for the application. Redundant data is removed altogether from the response. This web service is hosted on heroku.

# Part B
This is also connected with a MongoDB Atlas Cluster which stores user input and logs in order to display them on a dashboard. The dashboard fetches all data from MongoDB and performs calculations to render the output on the following webpage:-
